# Rainfall-Prediction-Deep-Learning
The issue being investigated is the prediction of the next day of the rainfall amount
With this, it will beneficial for a flood monitoring system in flood-prone areas in our case is in Kuantan, Pahang. 
This city near to the Kuantan river basin and vulnerable to flood experience. 
Four deep learning models MLP, LSTM, Stacked LSTM and hybrid CNN-LSTM will be developed and evaluated using the rainfall daataset.
This model using univariate time series dataset of rainfall amount(mm) within 43 years from January, 1 1975 to December,31 2017
